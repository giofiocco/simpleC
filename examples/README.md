# Examples

The `src` folder contains some simpleC examples,
use `make` to compile everything and `make run prg=<name> args=<args-for-jaris/sim>` to run both the version compiled with `cc` and with `simpleC`.
`clib_wrapper.c` is the wrapper for the `cc` version, a wrapper for the gnu c stdlib.
`c_stdlib.asm` is the wrapper for the jaris stdlib becasuse of the different calling method of functions in simpleC and what the jaris stdlib expects.
