do better pointer math

# Tokenizer
- binary litterals
- escape char in string
- maybe find the row end when changing the row instead of finding it when printing error

# Parser
- maybe code and param ecc return a ast with {NULL, NULL} for the forerror

# Typechecker
- maybe check if code is if or something with a block and then call typecheck_funcbody on it
- warn if no return in some function

# Compiler

# PostOpt
- remove dead code
