postopt both init and code
do better pointer math
astlist -> binary and semplify others
typedef array

# Tokenizer
- binary litterals
- escape char in string
- maybe find the row end when changing the row instead of finding it when printing error

# Parser

# Typechecker
- maybe check if code is if or something with a block and then call typecheck_funcbody on it
- warn if no return in some function

# Compiler
- array with expression as length in the stack

# PostOpt
- remove dead code
